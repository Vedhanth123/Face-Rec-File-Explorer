# Dependency Resolution Summary

## Fixed Issues

- Resolved compatibility issues between NumPy and OpenCV
- Fixed virtual environment activation and Python path issues
- Created specialized scripts to fix dependency issues
- Updated installation documentation with specific version requirements
- Added validation tools to verify system functionality

## Key Changes

1. **NumPy version**: Downgraded to 1.23.5 for full compatibility with OpenCV 4.5.5.64
2. **OpenCV version**: Set to 4.5.5.64 which is compatible with our face_recognition setup
3. **Installation scripts**: Updated to enforce compatible versions
4. **Environment handling**: Improved virtual environment activation in batch files
5. **Path management**: Ensured correct Python interpreter is used via PATH prioritization
6. **Troubleshooting documentation**: Added section about NumPy/OpenCV compatibility
7. **Created validation script**: Provides easy verification that all components work together

## How to Run the Fixed System

1. Run `validate_system.bat` to verify all components are working correctly
2. If any issues are detected, run `fix_dependencies.bat` to install compatible versions
3. Use `launch_gui.bat` to start the application with the graphical interface
4. For command-line usage, use `run_explorer.bat` which ensures the virtual environment is properly activated

### Virtual Environment Issues

If you encounter a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2'` error:

1. Try running the application with our wrapper scripts:
   - `run_explorer.bat` for command-line usage
   - `launch_gui.bat` for the graphical interface

2. If the error persists:
   - Run `test_fix.bat` to verify the environment
   - Then run `fix_dependencies.bat` to fix dependency issues

## Notes

- The face_recognition package reports version 1.2.3 internally but is listed as 1.3.0 in pip
- This discrepancy is normal and doesn't affect functionality
- All components now work together correctly for face detection and recognition

## Testing Completed

- Verified OpenCV imports correctly with NumPy 1.23.5
- Validated face detection functionality
- Confirmed all dependencies load together properly
- Tested installation scripts
