# How Face Recognition Works

This document explains the technology behind the face recognition system in this application.

## The Face Recognition Process

### 1. Face Detection

Before recognizing who is in a photo, the system must first locate the faces:

- The system scans each image pixel by pixel
- For each position, it looks for patterns that match a face
- Two detection models are available:
  - **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)**: Faster but less accurate
  - **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: More accurate but slower
- Once detected, each face is extracted and normalized

### 2. Face Encoding

After finding a face, the system must convert it into a format that can be compared:

- Each face is transformed into a "face encoding" (a list of 128 numbers)
- This encoding captures the unique features of the face
- These numbers represent measurements like:
  - Distance between the eyes
  - Width of the nose
  - Shape of the cheekbones
  - And many other subtle features
- The encoding is like a digital "fingerprint" of the face

### 3. Face Clustering

To make labeling easier, similar faces are grouped together:

- The system compares the numerical encodings of all faces
- Faces with similar encodings are clustered together using the DBSCAN algorithm
- This groups faces that likely belong to the same person
- You can adjust the tolerance to make clustering more or less strict

### 4. Face Recognition

Once you've labeled some faces, the system can recognize people in other photos:

- The system compares an unknown face encoding with all known face encodings
- It calculates the "distance" between the face encodings
- Faces with small distances are considered matches
- The system uses the closest match to identify the person

## Accuracy Considerations

Several factors affect recognition accuracy:

- **Image quality**: Better quality images lead to better recognition
- **Face angle**: Front-facing photos work best
- **Lighting conditions**: Even lighting improves accuracy
- **Changes in appearance**: Glasses, facial hair, or aging can affect recognition
- **Number of examples**: More labeled examples of each person improves accuracy

## Privacy and Data Security

Important privacy aspects of this application:

- All processing happens locally on your computer
- No data is sent to remote servers
- Face data is stored in a local database file
- You can delete this file any time to remove all face data
- The application doesn't use internet connectivity

## Technical Details

The system uses these key technologies:

- **dlib**: Open-source machine learning library providing the core algorithms
- **face_recognition**: Python library that simplifies using dlib
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision library for image processing
- **scikit-learn**: Used for clustering similar faces
- **NumPy**: Handles the numerical computations

The face recognition model is based on deep learning research that achieved 99.38% accuracy on standard benchmarks.
